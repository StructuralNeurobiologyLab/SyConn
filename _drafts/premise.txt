Teravoxel volume electron microscopy datasets from neural tissue can now be acquired in weeks, but data analysis requires years of manual labor (see also Fig. 1 --> timing plot <--). The SyConn framework uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and random forest classifiers (RFC) to infer a richly-annotated synaptic connectivity matrix from manual neurite skeleton reconstructions by automatically identifying mitochondria, synapses and their types, axons, dendrites, spines, myelin, somata and cell types.
