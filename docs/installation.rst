Setup
=====

Should you happen to have the example folder you would do in your home::

    unzip SyConnEx.zip
    unzip SyConnDenseCube.zip -d SyConnDenseCube
    cd SyConn
    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade



Else you can just install SyConn using  ``git`` and  ``pip``::

    git clone https://github.com/SyConn
    cd SyConn
    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
