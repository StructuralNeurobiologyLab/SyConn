Welcome to SyConn's documentation!
==================================

SyConn2 is an open source connectivity analysis toolkit that creates a annontated connectome 
from volume electron microscopy (VEM) and flood-filling neural network (FFN, not mandatory) data.
This data is used to semantically segment the resulting point clouds of cells and finally combine them at the cellular level.
SyConn2 works with both on-site high-performance compute environments and rentable cloud computing clusters.

The documentation is divided into the following section:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   instructions
   syconnapi
   testapi

:ref:`Instructions <Instuctions>` explains the usage of SyConn (installation, usage, etc.) 
as well as further contents (basic functionality, data structures, etc.). In :ref:`SyConnAPI <SyConnAPI>` 
the code is documented.
