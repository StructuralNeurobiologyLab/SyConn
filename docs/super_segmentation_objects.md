# SuperSegmentationObjects
`SuperSegmentationObjects` are defined by a set of `SegmentationObjects` (or as one connected component within the datasets RAG).
Each `SuperSegmentationObject` owns cellular objects (see section 'Mapping of cellular organelles'), attributes,
 a skeleton (merge result of all SV skeletons) and meshes (for cell outline and all cell organelles). It also provides an
 interface for analysis and visualization methods (e.g. cellular compartment, spine, cell type classification), 
 which will be described in more detail under 'Classification procedures' and 'Visualization'.
 
 In order to aggregate the mapping information of the cellular objects from SSO's supervoxels, see [here](object_mapping.md).
